    <p> Police brutality is the intentional excessive abuse by a police officer. Police abuse
      has many different forms that can arise in form of verbal attacks or physical intimidation.

      <p></p>
    <p><h4>Here are some steps you can take:</h4>
      <p>Do understand what constitutes police misconduct
 Danger: Police misconduct is a broad term used to describe any police actions which violate the rights
 of the citizens they encounter. Police officers have inherent authority, and officers who abuse this authority can cause great damage
 to the victims of the abuse. Police misconduct can take the form of false arrests, improper searches, forced confessions, harassment,
  police brutality and false imprisonment.

Some misconduct is intentional while other misconduct is a result of negligent, sloppy, and lazy police work. No matter what type of
misconduct suffered, a victim should consult with an attorney in order to discuss any necessary criminal defense or potential civil lawsuit.
<p></p>
<h4>Do know your options for reporting police misconduct</h4>

There are a few ways police victims can voice their grievances and indignation. Some  police departments have civil complaint departments that
record and investigate civilian complaints against the police.Another option for victims is to report the incident to the Internal Affairs division
 of the police department. With both of these sources you will be able to initiate an internal investigation into the misconduct. However, these
 options lack the potential for awarding the victim damages or compensation.(Only by starting a lawsuit will a victim be able to hold the offending
  officer accountable while simultaneously seeking monetary compensation). A victim can choose all or none of these options in reporting police
  misconduct
<p></p>
<h4>Do write down the details!</h4>

In any police misconduct lawsuit, the burden will be on the victim to prove the improper police actions. A victim’s testimony should prove police
involvement even if there was no arrest. Any details or information which can identify the offending officer will significantly bolster the victim’s
case. To that end, a victim should record the officer’s name, precinct, badge/shield number, patrol car number and any other information that could
help identify the involved police officer. To have a better understanding of the information WRITE it down as soon as possible.
<h4>Do take pictures and track down video footage</h4>

Pictures and videos are one of the best means of conveying to a jury the injuries suffered as a result of police misconduct and brutality.
Victims should immediately take pictures of any physical injuries or damaged property and then continue to document the injuries in the days,
weeks and months following the incident.Additionally capturing in video police misconduct can be of great help to victim. Victims should try
and track down all footage in order to strengthen the proofs in their case.
<p></p>
<h4>Do understand your goals</h4>

Each victim has a unique path to recovery from police misconduct. Some victims seek an apology while others want actions to be taken against the
offending officer.Victims need to think about their goals before taking an action.A lawsuits will demand monetary compensation but may not ensure
any direct consequences to the offending officer. Apologies are even harder to obtain. Therefore, victims should consult with an attorney and make
sure any civil or disciplinary actions taken are in line with the victim’s personal goals and recovery process.
